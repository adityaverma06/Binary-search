Binary search makes the searching process more efficient. Just like the linear search, the objective of the binary search is also to find the target value from a list of values such as an array. In fact, the binary search doesnâ€™t compare the target value with each element of the array. Instead, the binary search works in the following way.

We compare the target value with the middle element of the array. The binary search returns the index of the target if there is a match. Otherwise, if the target element is less than the middle element, the second half of the array is discarded and the value is again compared with the middle element of the first half of the array. In contrast, if the target value is larger than the middle element, the first half of the array is discarded and the value is compared with the middle element. The binary search repeats this process until either it finds the target element or there is no remaining element in the array.
